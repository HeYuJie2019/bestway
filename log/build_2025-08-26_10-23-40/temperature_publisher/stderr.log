[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtemperature_service.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "temperature_service", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "temperature_service" with any of the following names:

    temperature_serviceConfig.cmake
    temperature_service-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "temperature_service" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "temperature_service_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "temperature_service" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
